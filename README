README for part-3
My xmalloc is made to continue running and allow the user to make mistakes, then report them through stderr and give a status report upon exit.

make clean to clean up the .o and exec files.
make run-XX to run a specific test
make all to make all tests and link them
make test-XX.o to compile and link specific tests
make xmalloc.o to compile xmalloc.o
make test-XX to create exec for specific test

test-1.c Tests for double free using xmalloc
test-2.c Tests for memory leak by double malloc
test-3.c Tests for freeing an illegal pointers
test-4.c Tests an intentional memory leak
test-5.c Tests for standard, accepted use of xmalloc. xmalloc and xfree work properly
test-6.c Tests freeing pointer outside of malloc'd space.
test-7.c Tests freeing memory in the middle of a memory chunk

Non memory leak tests, memory is intentionally cleaned up as to not clutter the error messages.
